Tim Sherwood will welcome Gary Gardner back into his first team squad during pre-season to assess closely whether the 22-year-old can cut it for Aston Villa in the Premier League. Gardner has enjoyed a successful loan spell at Nottingham Forest and scored a superb free-kick in front of the Villa manager during the defeat to Watford at the City Ground. Sherwood is keen to see Gardner, a former England Under-21 player, train day-to-day before making up his mind and he has spoken previously about his desire for homegrown players to make an impact at the club. Gary Gardner (left) will report to Aston Villa for pre-season training to be assessed by Tim Sherwood . The Villa boss has inspired the club since being appointed and helped lead them to an FA Cup final. Gardner, born in Solihull, joined Villa's academy aged seven and last year was rewarded with a new contract that expires in June 2016 despite suffering serious knee injuries. 'I will go back to Villa in the summer and we will see what happens,' he said. 'When I am back there in training, it will be my chance to impress. Tim Sherwood will not have seen much of me in training, because I have not been there. 'Villa are the main club, I have been there since I was seven and it is the team I support. But Forest have been fantastic to me. It is definitely the second team in my heart. 'If I was made available for loan again next season, if it does not work out at Villa, Forest would be top of my list, definitely. It is the best loan move I have had.' Gardner scored a stunning free-kick against Watford with Sherwood in attendance at the City Ground.
